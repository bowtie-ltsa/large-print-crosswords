# data directory

On your local box, after executing the script to fetch and build large-print crossword puzzles, this directory will contain the puzzle files (*.puz) pulled from the interwebs and html files (*.html) constructed from them.

- Open the *.html files to print them.
- Delete any files you don't want to keep.
- You can always regenerate the files by re-running the script.
